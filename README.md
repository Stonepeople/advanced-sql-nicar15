# NICAR 2015: Advanced SQL with PostgreSQL
The code and data examples here were created for the 2015 National Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting conference held in Atlanta, Ga.

## Getting started

* This hands-on class will use the pgAdmin client to edit and run queries.

* In pgAdmin, load the `create-tables.sql` script and run it. This creates three tables and loads them with data.
  * **counties**: 2010 Census PL94 data.
  * **meat_poultry_inspect**: USDA data on plants that produce meat and poultry.
  * **acs_2012_stats**: Derived data from the 2012 American Community Survey.
